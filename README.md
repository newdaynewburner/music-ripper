# Music Ripper
An advanced tool for downloading large amounts of music
from YouTube in MP3 format. Can download either individual
songs or entire music albums. It also generates a standardized
filename for the downloads, and adds ID3 metadata tags either
automatically or manually, when appropriate. 

The program also boasts several methods of bypassing YouTube's 
bot detection algorithms and the resulting captcha/lockout when it is
triggered.
